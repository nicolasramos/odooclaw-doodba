## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Native Security & Permission Inheritance**: OdooClaw now dynamically assumes the
  Odoo permissions of the user interacting with the bot. All database (ORM) operations
  pass through a custom endpoint (`/odooclaw/call_kw_as_user`) enforcing Odoo's native
  Access Rights and Record Rules securely.
- **Smart Document Processing (OCR)**: Added capabilities to scan and understand
  invoices/purchase orders using specialized OCR MCP skills.
- **Intelligent Invoice & PO Creation**: Automatic lookup or creation of missing
  products and taxes when processing lines for Vendor Bills and Purchase Orders.
- **Voice Messages Support**: Full bidirectional voice support in Odoo Discuss
  - Speech-to-Text (STT): Transcribe voice notes using Whisper
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generate voice responses using Edge TTS
- **OCR vendor bill flow rebuilt**: `ocr-invoice` skill now supports provider-agnostic
  OpenAI-compatible vision extraction and a direct `ocr-create-vendor-bill` tool for
  attachment -> extraction -> bill creation.
- **Workforce toolset expansion**: Added attendance queries, task-oriented timesheet
  logging, personal task discovery/status update, check-in/check-out, daily summary,
  missing-timesheet detection, timesheet suggestions, expense report lifecycle, and
  pending-action notifications.
- **Accounting operations suite**: Added tools for unreconciled bank lines,
  reconciliation suggestions/actions, AR/AP aging, period-close checks, journal entries
  (create/post), tax summary, duplicate vendor-bill validation, expense account/tax
  suggestions, and OCR-validated vendor bill creation.
- **OCR expense flows**: Added `ocr-create-employee-expense` and
  `ocr-create-mileage-expense` (attachment -> extraction -> expense creation, with
  dry-run support).
- **Odoo private reply routing controls**: Added DM-only default mode plus optional
  group-mention mode with private reply targets and user-scoped session isolation.

### New MCP Skills

| Skill         | Description                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `whisper-stt` | Voice transcription with Whisper API (default) and Faster Whisper support (optional) |
| `edge-tts`    | Text-to-speech synthesis with Microsoft Edge TTS                                     |
| `ocr-invoice` | Parse PDF/Image invoices and optionally create vendor bills directly in Odoo         |

### Updated Components

- `mail_bot_odooclaw` module: Webhook now includes `voice_attachments` array, and added
  a safe `call_kw_as_user` controller for secure impersonation.
- `mail_bot_odooclaw` controller: Endpoint `/odooclaw/reply` accepts `attachment_ids`
  and `voice_metadata_ids`.
- `odoo-mcp` MCP server: Passes the `sender_id` to Odoo to enforce secure execution
  scopes.
- Odoo context injection in tool runtime: Added server/tool alias compatibility for
  `odoo-mcp` (legacy `odoo-manager` remains supported), ensuring `sender_id`,
  `company_id`, and `allowed_company_ids` are consistently injected from Odoo chat
  context.
- Odoo channel routing: Added `allow_group_mentions` config toggle
  (`ODOOCLAW_CHANNELS_ODOO_ALLOW_GROUP_MENTIONS`) with default `false` for DM-only
  behavior.
- Odoo webhook payload handling: Added `reply_model`/`reply_res_id` support to separate
  source thread from private reply target when group mentions are enabled.
- Odoo MCP security allowlist: Added Workforce/expense models (`hr.employee`,
  `hr.attendance`, `account.analytic.line`, `hr.expense`, `hr.expense.sheet`) to support
  check-in/checkout and expense flows without fallback access-denied errors.
- Provider tool-call extraction: Added compatibility for Gemma-style pseudo tool-call
  text (`<|toolcall>call:...{...}`) plus malformed JSON brace repair during extraction.
- OpenAI-compatible provider runtime: Added fallback parsing for content-only Gemma4
  pseudo tool-calls (`<|tool_call>...`) when `message.tool_calls` is empty, with nested
  payload argument normalization.
- Tool registry lookup: Added normalized/fuzzy matching fallback so model-emitted tool
  names with punctuation drift can still resolve to registered tools.
- Dockerfile: Added `edge-tts`, `aiohttp`, and `faster-whisper` dependencies
- `config.json`: Added `whisper-stt` and `edge-tts` MCP server configurations

### Fixed

- **Doodba installer interactive prompts**: Fixed `scripts/install_doodba.sh` prompt
  helpers so interactive labels are written to `stderr` instead of `stdout`. This
  prevents command-substitution capture corruption (for example, Odoo version validation
  receiving prompt text plus value) and restores reliable capture for
  version/DB/provider/API inputs.
