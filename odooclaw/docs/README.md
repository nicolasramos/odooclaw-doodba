  group mention mode, private reply targets, and user-scoped session isolation.

### 4. The Odoo MCP Server (`odoo-mcp`)

The core interaction of this agent with Odoo is governed by the
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) standard. We provide a
modular MCP server (Python) located at `odooclaw/workspace/skills/odoo-mcp`.

#### Why MCP?

MCP is the protocol promoted by Anthropic that standardizes how an LLM discovers and
uses external tools. By using MCP, we delegate the responsibility of connecting to Odoo
(via JSON-RPC / XML-RPC) to an isolated and secure process, which dynamically injects
its tools into the AI model in an agnostic way.

#### Available Capabilities

`odoo-mcp` replaces legacy monolithic access with granular tools and stricter
safeguards:

1. **Modular Odoo operations**:

   - Core tools such as `odoo_search`, `odoo_read`, `odoo_create`, `odoo_write`.
   - Safer business actions exposed as explicit tools instead of free-form unrestricted
     calls.
   - Business domains now include Workforce, Accounting, Helpdesk, and OCR-assisted
     accounting workflows.

2. **Permission-aware execution context**:

   - Calls are executed with the invoking user context to preserve Odoo ACLs and record
     rules.
   - Security controls include denylist/allowlist protections for sensitive
     models/operations.
   - Odoo chat identity context (`sender_id`, company scope) is auto-injected for
     `odoo-mcp` tool calls.

3. **Attachment/data workflows**:
   - Attachment handling and structured extraction remain supported through MCP skill
     composition.

#### Dependencies

The internal MCP server runs a Python process, so it assumes that the container or
environment where you run OdooClaw has Python 3 and `pandas` installed if you want to
make use of the Excel reading features.
